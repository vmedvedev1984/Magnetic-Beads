BOMB synthesis of MNPs
Note: All procedures can be performed under inert argon atmosphere (alternatively purging the system with high purity N2 for 30 min should be sufficient. We generally perform the reaction at atmospheric oxygen levels, however degas and heat up the solutions before use).
Degas the NaOH solution by filtering it with a vacuum filtering system–keep the vacuum running for 1 h while magnetically stirred.
Assemble the round bottom flask, dripping funnel and water bath according to Figure 1A and place on a magnetic stirrer. Add 100 ml of degassed 2 M NaOH to the collection flask on the bottom and the Fe2/3 solution to the dripping funnel. Heat up the flask containing the 2 M NaOH solution to 80-85 °C.
Note: Using freshly made Fe2/3 solution with the correct iron salts is crucial for the success of the reaction. Otherwise, the forming iron precipitate might lead to lower stability of MNPs as can be observed during washing steps or storing the beads.
Add 60 ml Fe2/3 solution drop wise into 100 ml of preheated (80-85 °C) 2 M NaOH solution while stirring vigorously (> 400 rpm).
Note: A black precipitate of Fe3O4 (FeO·Fe2O3) is formed.
After the complete Fe2/3 solution was added, add 10 ml of 25% ammonia solution to the reaction mixture. Stir for another 30 min and then cool to RT.
Transfer the solution to a sterile plastic container and magnetically pellet the black precipitate (MNPs), discard the supernatant.
Note: Ammonia containing trash needs to be discarded appropriately.
Resuspend in 200 ml of ddH2O, pellet magnetically and discard supernatant. Repeat for a total of 5 washes (or until the pH of the wash reaches ~7).
After the last wash, resuspend the MNPs in 30-40 ml of ddH2O and transfer to a fresh 50 ml tube.
Note: To measure the synthesis yield, magnetically pellet the MNPs, remove the water and weigh the product wet-mass. Alternatively, flash freeze the pelleted MNPs in liquid nitrogen and lyophilize and measure the dry mass. Lyophilised MNPs in N2 or argon atmosphere can be stored in a closed container at RT for a longer time. The wet MNPs slowly oxidize over time; therefore, we recommend coating them within a week.

BOMB Silica-coating
Note: All procedures can be performed under inert N2 atmosphere or atmospheric oxygen conditions. The protocol will work in both cases, however, the formation of brown precipitate (iron oxide) can be reduced or eliminated when working under N2 atmosphere and therefore, the stability of the uncoated beads can be increased.
Mix 2 L of 99% ethanol with 50 ml of 25% ammonia solution and ~22.5 g (wet mass) of the synthesized iron oxide MNPs (A) in a heat resistant 2.5 L bottle using a magnetic stirrer (300-400 rpm). Switch on the heating and allow the solution to heat up to ~80 °C.
Note: It is very important that the core particles are efficiently distributed in the solution. Otherwise, large clusters of MNPs are coated with silica, leading to a decreased performance of the beads in nucleic acid capture applications.
Add 45 ml tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS) with constant stirring and incubate for another 30 min.
Note: The size of the particles can be controlled using different ratios of core particles and TEOS. The standard ratio used in the above protocol is: 1 g of paramagnetic core particles to 2 ml TEOS, which results in particles with an average size of ~400 nm. Generally, more TEOS yields larger beads.
Add 400 ml of ddH2O to the solution.
Allow the reaction to proceed for > 4 h (ideally overnight).
Note: TEOS hydrolyzes spontaneously in water which will result in white silica precipitates which do not contain a paramagnetic core. If large amounts of this precipitate forms, use fresh TEOS for the reaction.
Cool the solution to RT.
Separate the coated MNPs using a strong neodymium magnet.
Note: Uncoated MNPs get slowly oxidized over time which is indicated by a brown color of the supernatant after magnetic separation.
Wash twice with pure water.
Wash twice with pure ethanol.
Wash with pure water until the pH of the solution becomes neutral (3-4 times).
Note: To measure the synthesis yield, magnetically pellet the silica beads, remove the water and weigh the product wet mass. The coated beads can be stored at RT for at least 1 year.

BOMB carboxyl-coating
Note: All procedures can be performed under inert N2 atmosphere or atmospheric oxygen conditions. The protocol will work in both cases, however, the formation of brown precipitate (iron oxide) can be reduced or eliminated when working under N2 atmosphere and therefore, the stability of the uncoated beads can be increased.
Mix 1 g (wet mass) of the synthesized iron oxide MNPs (A) dispersed in 45 ml of water and 1.15 g sodium dodecyl sulfate with 200 ml of purified, degassed water in a round bottom flask using a magnetic stirrer (300-400 rpm). Switch on the heating and allow the solution to heat up to ~70 °C.
Add 0.96 ml of methacrylic acid (MAA) into the flask.
Note: The pH drops to about 3.
Equilibrate the reaction mixture for about 45 min while keeping the temperature.
Add 1.98 g of the initiator potassium persulfate to the solution.
Let the polymerization reaction progress at ~70 °C for 2 h.
Cool the solution to RT.
Separate the coated MNPs from the free MAA and PMAA by concentrating the MNPs with a strong neodymium magnet and discarding the supernatant.
Note: Uncoated MNPs get slowly oxidized over time which is indicated by a brown color of the supernatant after magnetic separation.
Disperse the isolated paramagnetic nanoparticles in deionized water (e.g., in an ultrasonic bath), followed by magnetic extraction as described in Step C7.
Wash the beads with ddH2O at least 5 times or until the detergent is completely removed and disperse them in 250 ml of ddH2O.
Note: To measure the synthesis yield, magnetically pellet the silica beads, remove the water and weigh the product wet mass. The coated beads can be stored at RT for at least 1 year.
